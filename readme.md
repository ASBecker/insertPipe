## Synopsis

Allows configuration of RStudio to insert the dplyr pipe (%>%) at the current cursor position

## Motivation

The %>% pipe form the [dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr) package is a very useful tool to create human-readable and reproducible code. Configuring it to a keyboard shortcut saves me significant time during coding. I'm uploading it to GitHub in case anybody else finds it useful.

## Installation

Download the package and install with
``` r
install.packages("DOWNLOAD_FOLDER/insertPipe", repos = NULL, type="source")
```
Configure to shortcut of your choice in RStudio
